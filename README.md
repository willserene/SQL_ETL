<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

If data was publicly available, how would you obtain it?

*  Connects to Kaggle via API token using Python.  It extracts-and-unzips all files from the NHL Hockey source, which includes 13 CSVs.
*  Using pandas, CSVs are loaded to dataframes then prepared/transformed for their final migration to a PostgreSQL database.
*  PostgreSQL and pgAdmin were used to establish a mini-warehouse for all hockey data for analysis.
*  The Jupyter Notebook uses pandas to_sql(), as well as a custom function using execute_values() from psycopg2, to load the transformed data to the appropriate database tables.
*  Queries analyzing the data have been written in SQL.

Each dataframe load-to-PostgreSQL prints an execution time (modular), and the notebook also tracks the total process run time.
