<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

If data was publicly available, how would you obtain it?

*  The project connects to Kaggle via API token using Python.  It downloads-and-unzips all files from the NHL Hockey source, which includes 13 CSVs and an ERD.
*  Using pandas, the CSVs are loaded to dataframes.  These dataframes are prepared/transformed for their final migration to a PostgreSQL database.
*  We SQL and pgAdmin to create the database schema.  This establishes the mini-warehouse for all hockey data from which analysis can be performed.
*  The Jupyter Notebook uses pands to_sql(), as well as a custom function using execute_values() from psycopg2, to load the transformed dataframes to the appropriate PostgresSQL database tables.
*  Queries analyzing the data have been written in SQL.

Each dataframe load to SQL prints an execution time (modular) and a total process run time.
